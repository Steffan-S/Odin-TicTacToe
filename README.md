# Assignment: Build Tic Tac Toe

### Objective:
We‚Äôre making a Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser!

### Task:

- You‚Äôre going to store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object
- Your main goal here is to have as little global code as possible. Try tucking as much as you can inside factories.
- In this project, think carefully about where each bit of logic should reside. Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects. Take care to put them in ‚Äúlogical‚Äù places.
- Focus on getting a working game in the console first. Make sure you include logic that checks for when the game is over! You should be checking for all winning 3-in-a-rows and ties.
- Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic.
- Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elements (e.g. letting players click on a board square to place their marker).
- Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!
